Arquillian Container for Cloudbees

For the moment, it is hardcoded : no configuration except ~/.cloudbees/cloudbees-api.properties.
CDI is working on my example.
JAX-RS as-client is working on my example.
The EJB enricher does not work because the JNDI names in Cloudbees are not compliant with Arquillian's lookup.
